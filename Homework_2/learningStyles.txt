Learning styles play an important role in our education. With each of us having different ways of learning that tend to be more effective for us, it is helpful to know how you learn best. I personally learn best through doing and watching, kinetic and visual. I am a hands-on type of person, so I can struggle with trying to learn just from books or ideas that don’t have a lot of hands-on learning options. One of the best things about knowing your learning style with so many places to learn is that you can look for the best option to fit your learning style. I have had classes where the instruction and content really didn’t fit me well, but I was able to go online and find people teaching the topics in ways that worked much better for me. I know that each of us has different ways that help us learn best and different instructors will have a different impact on each of us because of these differences. It is a valuable skill to know what your learning style is and how to seek out instruction that fits it.
