The last lecture was an interesting and impactful video. Knowing that the speaker was using the end of his life to pass on this information made its importance very clear, and his passion for sharing it was inspiring. I have always enjoyed the story of the imagineers and how they pushed the boundaries of what people think is possible from the very beginning when Walt Disney was working with them to create Disneyland, so his story about how he got a job with them caught my attention. Persistence and taking advantage of opportunities when they came up was a big take away from this story. From being turned down and going a different direction and then coming full circle and ending up at imagineering showed just how life can lead us on a winding road to get us where we want to be.
